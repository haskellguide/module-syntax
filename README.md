# syntax module

Welcome to the syntax module of the [HaskellGuide study plan](https://github.com/haskellguide/haskell-study-guide) which is a syllabus that is uniquely tailored to those who *learn by doing*, rather than *learn by reading*.  What makes HaskellGuide unique is the focus and care in ensuring your learning experience is buttery smooth.

No software installation will be required at any stage as we have integrated with the lovely folks at GitHub Education and GitPod to deliver you a world class experience. With HaskellGuide you'll learn faster and start authoring code sooner. 

In this module you'll be introduced to functional programming concepts, the syntax of Haskell and you are provided with easy excercises to apply your learnings in a fully configured modern web-based IDE. We assume experience with programming but absolutely no exposure to functional programming concepts or Haskell.

If you experience any isues at all, please open a GitHub issue and leave feedback. We ❤️ contributions and pull-requests.

# you can do this

Don't feel you aren't smart enough. Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough. We have found through observation that this is especially true for when a new paradigm needs to be learned:

On the other hand, less words will be spent on how to approach writing the program, e.g. how to set up your tooling, how to please Haskell’s layout rules, how to design your data type, which libraries to pick, how to read error messages. That said, we hope that even Haskell programmers will gain useful insight from tutorial.

Nevertheless it is hard to understand a programming paradigm without writing any code, so there will some amount of hands-on work to be done, especially early on, when we start with a introduction to basic functional programming.

I expect the audience to be familiar with programming and computer science in general, but do not assume prior knowledge of functional program (or, in case you are worried about this, category theory).

The exercises are all very small, in the order of minutes, and are meant to be done along the way, especially as later material may refer to their results. If you are reading this on your own and you really do not feel like doing them, you can click on the blurred solutions to at least read them. The exercises are not sufficient in number and depths to provide the reader the experience needed to really learn Haskell.

Some sections are marked with ★. These are optional in the sense that the following material does not rely heavily on them. If time is short, e.g. during a workshop, they can be skipped, and the participants can be invited to come back to them on their own.



# the basics of functional programming

Functional program is the the art of thinking about *data* and how the new data is calculated from old data, rather than thinking about how to *modify* data.

## numbers and arithmetic operators

The simplest form of data are numbers, and basic arithmetic is one way of creating new numbers from old numbers.

To play around with this, start the Haskell REPL (“read-eval-print-loop”) by running `ghci` (or maybe on [tryhaskell.org](https://tryhaskell.org/)), and enter some numbers, and some of the usual arithmetic operations:

```haskell
$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.4.4: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> 1
1
Prelude> 1 + 1
2
Prelude> 2 + 3 * 4
14
Prelude> (2 + 3) * 4
20
```

At this point we can tell that the usual precedence rules apply (i.e. the [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Mnemonics)).

```haskell
Prelude> 0 - 1
-1
```
Numbers can be negative…

```haskell
Prelude> 2^10
1024
Prelude> 2^2^10
17976931348623159077293051907890247336179769789423065727343008115773267580550096
31327084773224075360211201138798713933576587897688144166224928474306394741243777
67893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110

Prelude> (2^2)^10
1048576
```

…and also very large. By default, Haskell uses arbitrary precision integer arithmetic. Note that for this lecture, we will completely avoid and ignore floating point arithmetic.

In the last example we can see that Haskell interprets `a^b^c` as `a^(b^c)`, i.e. the power operator is *right associative*. It is worth noting that this information is not hard-coded in the compiler. Instead, when the operator is defined somewhere in a library, its associativity and precedence can be declared. We can ask the compiler about this information:

```haskell
Prelude> :info (^)
(^) :: (Num a, Integral b) => a -> b -> a 	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Real’
infixr 8 ^
```
Let us ignore the first line (which is the type signature): The `r` in `infixr` tells us that the `(^)` operator is right-associative. And the number is the precedence; a higher number means that this operator binds more tightly.

## excercises
<details>
<summary>What associativity do you expect for `(+)` and `(-)`? Verify your expectation.
</summary>
Both operator are left-associative, so that `10 - 2 + 3 - 4` means `((10 - 2) + 3) - 4` as expected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Look up the precedences of the other arithmetic operations, and see how that corresponds to the PEMDAS rule.</summary>
The precedences of `(+)` and `(-)` are the same, and smaller than the precedence of `(*)`, which is again shorter than the precedence of `(^)`.
</details>

# applying functions

So far we have a calculator (which is not useless, I sometimes use `ghci` as a calculator). But to get closer to functional programming, let us look at some functions that are already available to use.

To stay within the realm of arithmetic (if only to have something to talk about), let us play with the `div` and `mod` functions. These do what you would expect from them:

```haskell
Prelude> div 123 100
1
Prelude> mod 123 100
23
```

We observe that to apply a function, we just write the function, followed by the arguments; no parenthesis or commas needed. This not only makes for more elegant and less noise code; but there is also a very deep and beautiful reason for this, which we will come to later.

At this point, surely someone wants to know what happens when we divide by 0:

```haskell
Prelude> div 123 0
*** Exception: divide by zero
```

Haskell has exceptions, they can even be caught etc., but let us talk about that later.

Of course, if the argument is not just a single number, we somehow have to make clear where the argument begins and ends:

```haskell
Prelude> div (120 + 3) (10 ^ 2)
1
```

(If you leave out the parenthesis, you get a horrible error messages). In technical terms, we can say that function application behaves like a left-associative operator of highest precedence. But it is easier to just remember **function application binds most tightly**. (Exception: Record construction and update binds even more tightly, although some consider that a design flaw.)

Just to have more examples, here are two other functions that we can play around with:

```haskell
Prelude> id 42
42
Prelude> const 23 42
23
```

<details>
<summary>Can you predict the result of the following?

```haskell
Prelude> 1 + const 2 3 + 4
```
</summary>

The answer is:
```haskell
Prelude> 7
```
</details>

**A note on syntactic sugar:** Haskell is a high-calorie language: There is lots of syntactic sugar. Syntactic sugar refers to when there are alternative ways of writing something that *look* different, but *behave* the same. The goal is to allow the programmer to write the code in a way that best suits the reader, which is good, but it also means that a reader needs to know about the sugar.


**Infix operator application (syntactic sugar)**:
Functions that take two arguments can be written infix, as if they were an operator, by putting backticks around the name:

```haskell
Prelude> 123 `div` 10
12
Prelude> 123 `mod` 10
3
Prelude> (120 + 3) `div` (10 ^ 2)
1
Prelude> (120 + 3) `div` 10 ^ 2
1
Prelude> ((120 + 3) `div` 10) ^ 2
144
```
We see that written as operators, even functions have an associativity and precedence:

```haskell
Prelude> :info div
class (Real a, Enum a) => Integral a where
  ...
  div :: a -> a -> a
  ...
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Real’
infixl 7 `div`
```

**Prefix operator application (syntactic sugar) ★**:
We can also go the other way, and use any operator as if it were a function, by wrapping it in parentheses:

```haskell
Prelude> 1 + 1
2
Prelude> (+) 1 1
2
```

**The dollar operator (non-syntactic sugar) ★**:
Consider an expression that takes a number, and applies a number of functions , maybe with arguments, to it, such as:

```haskell
f5 (f4 (f3 (f2 (f1 42))))
```

Passing a piece of data through a number of functions is very common, and some (including me) greatly dislike the accumulation of parentheses there. Therefore, it is idiomatic to use the `($)` operator:

```haskell
f5 $ f4 $ f3 $ f2 $ f1 42
```
This operator takes a function as the first argument, an argument as the second argument, and applies the function to the argument. In that way, it is exactly the same as function application. But it is *right-associative* (instead of left-associative) and has the *lowest precedence* (instead of the highest precedence). An easier way of reading such code is to read `($)` as “the same as parenthesis around the rest of the line”.

I call this non-syntactic sugar, because the dollar operator it is not part of the built-in language, but can be define by anyone.

</details>

# booleans and branching
----------------------

Some cryptographers might be happy to only write code that always does the same thing (yay, no side effects), but most of us pretty quickly want to write branching code.

As you would expect, Haskell has the usual operators to compare numbers:

```haskell
Prelude> 1 + 1 == 2
True
Prelude> 4 < 5
True
Prelude> 4 >= 5
False
Prelude> 23 /= 42
True
```

We see that there are values `True` and `False`. We can combine them using the usual Boolean operators:

```haskell
Prelude> 1 + 1 == 2 && 5 < 4
False
Prelude> 1 + 1 == 2 || 5 < 4
True
```

And finally, we can use `if … then … else …` to branch based on such a Boolean expression:

```haskell
Prelude> if 5 < 0 then 0 else 1
1
Prelude> if -5 < 0 then 0 else 1
0
```

The use of `if … then … else …` is actually not the most idiomatic way to code decisions in Haskell, and we will come back to that point later, but for now it is good enough.

# function abstraction

Assume you want to check a bunch of numbers as to whether they are multiples of 10 (so called “round numbers” in German). You can do that using `mod` and `(==)`:

```haskell
Prelude> 5 `mod` 10 == 0
False
Prelude> 10 `mod` 10 == 0
True
Prelude> 11 `mod` 10 == 0
False
Prelude> 20 `mod` 10 == 0
True
Prelude> -20 `mod` 10 == 0
True
Prelude> 123 `mod` 10 == 0
False
```

But this gets repetitive quickly. And whenever we program something in a repetitive way, we try to recognize the *pattern* and abstract over the changing *parameter*, leaving only the common parts

Here, the common pattern is ``x `mod` 10 == 0``, with a parameter named `x`. We can give this pattern a name, and use it instead:

```haskell
Prelude> isRound x = x `mod` 10 == 0
Prelude> isRound 5
False
Prelude> isRound 10
True
Prelude> isRound 11
False
Prelude> isRound 20
True
Prelude> isRound (-20)
True
Prelude> isRound 123
False
```

And now we are squarely in the realm of functional programming, as we have just defined out first function, `isRound`!

Note that we defined the `isRound` by way of an equation. And it really is an equation: Wherever we see `isRound something`, we can obtain its meaning by replacing it with ``something `mod` 10 == 0``. This *equational reasoning*, where you replace equals by equals, is one key technique to make sense of Haskell programs.

```
</details>

Of course, you can abstract over more than one parameter. In the last exercise, you had to write something like ``x `div` 10 == y`` a lot. So it makes sense to abstract over that:

```haskell
Prelude> hasLastDigit x y = x `div` 10 == y
```

This allows us to define `isHalfRound` as follows:

```haskell
Prelude> isHalfRound x = x `hasLastDigit` 0 || x `hasLastDigit` 5
```
which, if you read it out, is almost a transliteration of the specification! Here we see how abstraction, together with good naming and syntax, can produce very clear and readable code.

**Infix operator application again (syntactic sugar)**:
By the way, you can use infix operator syntax already when defining a function:

```haskell
x `divides` y = x `div` y == 0
```

# recursion

We already saw that one function that we defined could call another. But the real power of general computation comes when a function can call itself, i.e. when we employ recursion. Recursion is a very fundamental technique in functional programming, much more so than loops or iterators or such.

Let us come up with a function that determines the number of digits in a given number. We first check if the number is already just one digit:

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits n = if n < 10 then 1 else
```

At this point, we know that the number is larger than 10. So to count the digits, we would like to cut off one digit:

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits n = if n < 10 then 1 else (n `div` 10)
```

and count the number of digits of *that* number

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits n = if n < 10 then 1 else countDigits (n `div` 10)
```

and, of course, add one to that number:

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits n = if n < 10 then 1 else countDigits (n `div` 10) + 1
Prelude> countDigits 0
1
Prelude> countDigits 5
1
Prelude> countDigits 10
2
Prelude> countDigits 11
2
Prelude> countDigits 99
2
Prelude> countDigits 100
3
Prelude> countDigits 1000
4
Prelude> countDigits (10^12345)
12346
```

The fact that we can replace equals with equals does not change just because we use recursion. For example, we can figure out what `countDigits 789` does by replacing equals with equals:

```haskell
  countDigits 789
= if 789 < 10 then 1 else countDigits (789 `div` 10) + 1
= if False then 1 else countDigits (789 `div` 10) + 1
= countDigits (789 `div` 10) + 1
= countDigits 78 + 1
= (if 78 < 10 then 1 else countDigits (78 `div` 10) + 1) + 1
= (if False then 1 else countDigits (78 `div` 10) + 1) + 1
= (countDigits (78 `div` 10) + 1) + 1
= (countDigits 7 + 1) + 1
= ((if 7 < 10 then 1 else countDigits (7 `div` 10) + 1) + 1) + 1
= ((if True then 1 else countDigits (7 `div` 10) + 1) + 1) + 1
= (1 + 1) + 1
= 2 + 1
= 3
```

<details>
<summary>
Write the function `sumDigits` that sums up the digits of a natural number.
</summary>

```haskell
sumDigits n = if n < 10 then n else sumDigits (n `div` 10) + (n `mod` 10)
```
</details>

# higher-order functions

We created functions when we took expressions that followed a certain pattern, and abstracted over a number that occurred therein. But the thing we can abstract over does not have to be just a simple number. It could also be a function!

Consider the task of calculating the number of digits in the number of digits of a number:

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits (countDigits 5)
1
Prelude> countDigits (countDigits 10)
1
Prelude> countDigits (countDigits (10^10))
2
Prelude> countDigits (countDigits (10^123))
3
Prelude> countDigits (countDigits (15^15))
2
```

Clearly, we can abstract over the argument here:

```haskell
Prelude> countCountDigits n = countDigits (countDigits n)
Prelude> countCountDigits (10^123)
3
```

But now consider we also want `sumSumDigits`:

```haskell
Prelude> sumSumDigits n = sumDigits (sumDigits n)
Prelude> sumSumDigits (9^9)
9
Prelude> sumSumDigits (7^7)
7
Prelude> sumSumDigits (13^13)
13
Prelude> sumSumDigits (15^15)
18
```

There is clearly a pattern that is shared by both `countCountDigits` and `sumSumDigits`: They both apply a function twice. And indeed, we can abstract over that pattern:

```haskell
Prelude> twice f x = f (f x)
Prelude> twice countDigits (15^15)
2
Prelude> twice sumDigits (15^15)
18
```
This is our first *higher order function*, and it is called so because it is a function that take another function as an argument. More precisely, it is called a second-order function, because it takes a normal, i.e. first-order function, as an argument. Abstracting over a second order function yields a third order function, and so on. Up to [sixth-order functions](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796898003001) are seen in the wild.

If you look at the last two lines, we again see a common pattern. And abstracting over that, we recover very nice and declarative definitions for `countCountDigits` and `sumSumDigits`:

```haskell
Prelude> countCountDigits x = twice countDigits x
Prelude> sumSumDigits x = twice sumDigits x
```

The ability to abstract very easily over functions is an important ingredient in making Haskell so excellent at abstraction: It allows to abstract over *behavior*, instead merely over *value*. To demonstrate that, let us recall the definitions of `countDigits` and `someDigits`:

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits n = if n < 10 then 1 else countDigits (n `div` 10) + 1
Prelude> sumDigits n = if n < 10 then n else sumDigits (n `div` 10) + (n `mod` 10)
```

These two functions share something: They share a behavior! Both iterate over the digits of the function, do something at each digit, and sum something up. And this common functionality is not trivial! So it is very unsatisfying to copy’n’paste it, like we did. So how can we abstract over the parts that differ? It is not obvious on first glance, so go through it step by step, lets give the parts that differ names. For `countDigits`, we *ignore* the digit, and just sum up ones:

```haskell
Prelude> always1 n = 1
Prelude> countDigits n = if n < 10 then always1 n else countDigits (n `div` 10) + always1 (n `mod` 10)
```

And for `sumDigits`, we use the digit as is. And we have already seen a function that just returns its argument, the identity function:

```haskell
Prelude> sumDigits n = if n < 10 then id n else sumDigits (n `div` 10) + id (n `mod` 10)
```

Now the common pattern is clear, and we can abstract over the different parts:

```haskell
Prelude> sumDigitsWith f n = if n < 10 then f n else sumDigitsWith f (n `div` 10) + f (n `mod` 10)
Prelude> countDigits n = sumDigitsWith always1 n
Prelude> sumDigits n = sumDigitsWith id n
```

To recapitulate: We took two functions that were doing somehow related things, and we rewrote them to clearly separate the common parts from the differing parts, and then we could extract the shared essence into its own, higher-order function.

This single mechanism -- abstracting over functions -- can [replace thick volumes full of design patterns](https://www.voxxed.com/2016/04/gang-four-patterns-functional-light-part-1/) in non-functional programming paradigms.

Note that if one would have to abstract `countDigits` and `sumDigits` to `sumDigitsWith` in practice, one would probably not rewrite them first with `id` etc., but just look at them and come up with `sumDigitsWith` directly.

# anonymous functions

We defined a function `always1`, but it seems a bit silly to give a name to such a specialized and small concept. Therefore, Haskell allows us to define *anonymous functions* on the fly. The syntax is a backslash, followed by the parameter (or parameters), followed by the body of the function. So we can define `countDigits` and `sumDigits` without any helper functions like this:

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits n = sumDigitsWith (\d -> 1) n
Prelude> sumDigits n = sumDigitsWith (\d -> d) n
```

These are also called *lambda abstractions*, because they are derived from the Lambda calculus, and the backslash is a poor imitation of the Greek letter lambda (λ).

# higher-order function definition

Lets look at the previous two definitions, and remember that when we define a function this way, we define what to replace the left-hand side with. But notice that the argument `n` is not touched at all by this definition! So we should get the same result if we simply omit it from the equation, right? And indeed, we can just as well write

```haskell
Prelude> countDigits = sumDigitsWith (\d -> 1)
Prelude> sumDigits = sumDigitsWith (\d -> d)
```

It looks as if we just saved two characters. But what really just happened is that we shifted our perspective, and raised the level of abstraction by one layer. Instead of defining a `countDigits` as a function that takes a number and produces another number, we have defined `countDigits` as the result of instantiating the pattern `sumDigitsWith` with the function `(\d -> 1)`. At this level of thought, we do not care about the argument to `countDigits`, i.e. what it is called or so.

Currying
--------

We have already seen functions that *receive* a function as an argument. The way we use `twice` or `sumDigitsWith` here, we can think of them as a function that *return* functions. And this brings us to the deep and beautiful explanation we write multiple arguments to functions the way we do: Because really, every function only ever has one argument, and returns another one.

We can *think* of `twice` has having two arguments (the function `f`, and the value `x`), but really, `twice` is a function that takes one argument (the function `f`), and returns another function, that then takes the value `x`. This “other” function is what we named in the above definition of `sumSumDigits`.

The composition operator ★
--------------------------

Because writing code that passes functions around and modifies them (like in `twice` or `sumDigitsWith`) is so important in this style of programming, I should at this point introduce the composition operator. It is already pre-defined, but we can define it ourselves:
```
Prelude> (f . g) x = f (g x)
```
The dot is a poor approximation of the mathematical symbol for function composition, “∘”, and can be read as “`f` after `g`”. Note `x` is passed to `g` first, and then the result to `f`.

It looks like a pretty vacuous definition, but it is very useful in writing high-level code. For example, it allows us the following, nicely abstract definition of `twice`:
```
Prelude> twice f = f . f
```

Do you remember the example we used when introducing the dollar operator? We started with
```
f5 (f4 (f3 (f2 (f1 42))))
```
and rewrote it to
```
f5 $ f4 $ f3 $ f2 $ f1 42
```

Now imagine we want to abstract over 42:
```
many_fs x = f5 (f4 (f3 (f2 (f1 x))))
```
This function really is just the composition of a bunch of function. So an idiomatic way of writing it would be
```
many_fs  = f5 . f4 . f3 . f2 . f1
```
where again, the actual value is no longer the emphasis, but rather the functions.

The value `x` is sometimes called the point (as in geometry), and this style of programming is called *points-free* (or sometimes *pointless*).


Laziness ★
----------

As a final bit in this section, let’s talk about laziness. Most often this can be ignored when reading Haskell code, and in general laziness is not as important (or as bad) as some people say it is. But it plays an important role in Haskell’s support for abstraction, so let’s briefly look at it.

Laziness means that an expression is evaluated as late as possible, i.e. when it is needed to make a branching decision, or when it is to be printed on the screen. We can only observe when things are being evaluated when we have side-effects, and the only side effects we can produce so far are non-termination and exceptions. So let us use division by zero to observe that the first argument to `const` is used, but the second one is not:
```
Prelude> 0 `div` 0
*** Exception: divide by zero
Prelude> const (0 `div` 0) 1
*** Exception: divide by zero
Prelude> const 1 (0 `div` 0)
1
```

To see why this is so crucial for abstraction, consider the following two functions that implement a safe version of `div` and `mod` that just returns 0 if the user tries to divide by 0:
```
Prelude> x `safeDiv` y = if y == 0 then 0 else x `div` y
Prelude> x `safeMod` y = if y == 0 then 0 else x `mod` y
Prelude> 10 `safeDiv` 5
2
Prelude> 10 `safeDiv` 0
0
```

Clearly, the definitions of `safeDiv` and `safeMod` share a pattern. So let us extract the pattern “if y is zero then return zero else do something else”:

```
Prelude> unlessZero y z = if y == 0 then 0 else z
Prelude> x `safeDiv` y = unlessZero y (x `div` y)
Prelude> x `safeMod` y = unlessZero y (x `mod` y)
Prelude> 10 `safeDiv` 5
2
Prelude> 10 `safeDiv` 0
0
```
So that works. But it only works because Haskell is lazy. Consider what would happen in a strict language, where expressions are evaluated before passed to a function:

```
  10 `safeDiv` 0
= unlessZero 0 (10 `div` 0)
= unlessZero 0 (*** Exception: divide by zero
```

Only with laziness can we easily abstract not only over computations, but even over control flow, and create our own control flow constructs -- simply as higher-order functions!

In fact, even `if … then … else` could just be a normal function with three parameters, defined somewhere in the standard library. The fact that there is special syntax for it is pure convenience -- which, again, is not the case in strict languages.

Types
=====

In the first section, we have seen how functional programming opens the way to abstraction, and to condense independent concerns into separate pieces of code. This is a very powerful tool for modularity, and to focus on the relevant part of a problem, while keeping the bookkeeping out of sight. But powerful is also dangerous -- using a higher order function correctly without any aid, can be mind-bending.

Whenever we write functions like in the previous section, we have an idea in our head about what their arguments are -- are they just numbers, or are they functions, and what kind of functions -- and what they return. It is obvious to us that writing `twice isEven` does not make sense, because `isEven` returns `True` or `False`, but expects a number, so it cannot be applied to itself.

This is all simple and obvious, but it is a lot to keep in your head as the code grows larger, and even more so once the code is changing and there are more people working on it.  So to keep this power and complexity manageable, Haskell has a strong static type system, which is essentially a way for you to communicate with the compiler about these ideas you have in your head. You can ask the compiler “what do you know about this function? what can it take, what kind of things does it return?”. And you can tell the compiler “this function ought to take this and return that (and please tell me if you disagree)”.

In fact, many Haskellers prefer to do type-driven development: First think about and write down the type of the function they need to create, and *then* think about implementing them.

Besides communicating with the compiler, types are also crucial in communicating with your fellow developers and/or users of your API. For many functions, the type alone, or the type and the name, is sufficient to tell you what it does.

Tooling interlude: Editing files ★
----------------------------------

At this point, we should switch from working exclusively in the REPL to writing an actual Haskell file. We can start by creating a file `Types.hs`, and put in the code from the previous section:

```haskell
isRound x = x `mod` 10 == 0
hasLastDigit x y = x `div` 10 == y
isHalfRound x = x `hasLastDigit` 0 || x `hasLastDigit` 5
x `divides` y = x `div` y == 0
twice f x = f (f x)
countCountDigits x = twice countDigits x
sumSumDigits x = twice sumDigits x
sumDigitsWith f n = if n < 10 then f n else sumDigitsWith f (n `div` 10) + f (n `mod` 10)
countDigits = sumDigitsWith (\d -> 1)
sumDigits = sumDigitsWith (\d -> d)
fixEq f x = if f x == x then x else fixEq f (f x)
isMultipleOf3 x = fixEq sumDigits x == 3 || fixEq sumDigits x == 6 || fixEq sumDigits x == 9
```

We can load this file into `ghci` by either starting it with `ghci Types.hs` or by typing `:load Types.hs`. After you change and save the file, you can reload with `:reload` (or simply `:r`)

Basic types
-----------

As I mentioned before, you can chat with the compiler about the types of things, and ask what it thinks they are. We can do that with the `:type` (or `:t`) command:

```
*Main> :t sumDigits
sumDigits :: Integer -> Integer
```

Here, GHC tells us the type of `sumDigits`, in the form of a *type annotation*, i.e. a term (`sumDigits`) followed by two colons, followed by its type. The type itself tells us that `sumDigits` is a function (as indicated by the arrow) that takes an `Integer` as an argument and returns an `Integer` as a result. Which greatly matches our expectation!

Instead of asking GHC for the type, we can also specify it, simply by adding the line
```haskell
sumDigits :: Integer -> Integer
```
to the file (commonly directly above the function definition, rarely all bundled up in the beginning).

If we insert a type annotation that does not match what we wrote in the code, for example, if we added
```haskell
isRound :: Integer -> Integer
```
we would get an error message like
```
types.hs:2:13: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Bool’
    • In the expression: x `mod` 10 == 0
      In an equation for ‘isRound’: isRound x = x `mod` 10 == 0
  |
2 | isRound x = x `mod` 10 == 0
  |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Note that the compiler believes the type signature, and complains about the code, not the other way around.

The error message mentions a type `Bool` which, as you can guess, is the type of Boolean expressions, e.g. `True` and `False`. With this knowledge, we can write the correct type signature for `isRound`:

```haskell
isRound :: Integer -> Bool
```

Polymorphism
------------

Let us consider `twice` for a moment, and think about what expect from its type. It is a function that takes two arguments, the and the first ought to be a function itself... and here is how GHC writes this:
```
*Main> :t twice
twice :: (t -> t) -> t -> t
```

From this example, we learn that
 * the type of functions with multiple arguments is written using multiple arrows,
 * the function arrow can just as occur inside an argument, namely when an argument itself is a function.

But what is this type `t`? There is not, actually, a type called `t`. Instead, this is a *type variable*, meaning that the function `twice` can be used with any type. Any lower-case identifier in a type is a type variable (not just `t`), and concrete types are always upper-case.

Here we can see that we can use `twice` with numbers, Booleans, and even with functions:
```
*Main> twice countDigits (99^99)
3
*Main> twice not True
True
*Main> twice twice countDigits (99^99)
1
```

What does not work is passing a function to `twice` that works on numbers, but then pass a `Bool`:
```
*Main> twice countDigits True

<interactive>:12:19: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Bool’
    • In the second argument of ‘twice’, namely ‘True’
      In the expression: twice countDigits True
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = twice countDigits True
```

In other words: The `t`s in the type of `twice` can become *any* type, but it has the be the same type everywhere.

::: Exercise
What do you think is the type of `id`?
:::

::: Solution
```haskell
id :: a -> a
```
:::


If we ask for the type of the function `const`, we see two different type variables:
```
*Main> :t const
const :: a -> b -> a
```
And here we can indeed instantiate them at different types:
```
*Main> :t const True 1
const True 1 :: Bool
```

Constrained types (a first glimpse)
-----------------------------------

There are more polymorphic functions in our initial set, for example `fixEq`:
```
*Main> :t fixEq
fixEq :: Eq t => (t -> t) -> t -> t
```
The part after the `=>` is what we expect: two arguments, the first a function, all the same types, just like with `twice`. The part before the `=>` is new: It is a *constraint*, and it limits which types `t` can be instantiated with. Remember that `fixEq` uses `(==)` to check if the value has stabilized. But not all values can be compared for equality! (In particular, functions cannot). So `fixEq` does not work with any type, but only those that support equality. This is what `Eq t` indicates, and indeed we get an error message when we try to do it wrongly:
```
*Main> fixEq twice not True

<interactive>:27:1: error:
    • No instance for (Eq (Bool -> Bool)) arising from a use of ‘fixEq’
        (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)
    • In the expression: fixEq twice not True
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = fixEq twice not True
```
This `Eq` thing is not some built-in magic, but rather a *type class*, another very powerful and important feature of Haskell, which we will dive into separately later.

Other functions in our list are polymorphic where we may not have expected it:
```
*Main> :t sumDigitsWith
sumDigitsWith :: (Integral a1, Num a2) => (a1 -> a2) -> a1 -> a2
```
This is not the type we might have expected! This is because Haskell supports different numeric types, and uses type classes to overload the numeric operations. But remember that typing is a conversation: We can simply tell GHC that we want a different (more specific) type for `sumDigitsWith`, by adding
```haskell
sumDigitsWith :: (Integer -> Integer) -> Integer -> Integer
```
to our file. In fact, in practice one *always* writes full type signatures for all top-level definitions, so this should be less of a problem for Haskell readers.

Parametricity
-------------

One obvious use for such polymorphism is to write code once, and use it at different types. But there is another great advantage of polymorphic functions, even if we only ever intend to instantiate the type variables with the same type, and that is reasoning by parametricity.

In a function with a polymorphic type like `twice` there is not a lot we can do with the parameters. Sure, we can apply `f` to `x`, and maybe apply `f` more than once. But that is just about all we can do: Because `x` can have an arbitrary type, we cannot do arithmetic with it, we cannot print it, we cannot even compare it to other values of type `x`.

This severely restricts what `twice` can do at all … but on the other hand means that just from looking at the type signature of `twice` we already know a lot about what it does.

A very simple example for that is the function `id`, with type `a -> a`. *Any* function of this type will either

* return its argument (i.e. be the identity function),
* return never (i.e. go into an infinite loop), or
* raise an exception.

::: Exercise
A great example for the power of polymorphism is the following type signature:
```
(a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
```
There is a function of that type in the standard library. Can you tell what it does? Can you guess its name? You can use a type-based search engine like [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=%28a+-%3E+b+-%3E+c%29+-%3E+b+-%3E+a+-%3E+c) to find the function.
:::

::: Solution
It is the function `flip` that takes a function and swaps its first two arguments.
:::

Algebraic data types
--------------------

The function type is very expressive, and one can model many data structures purely with functions. But of course it is more convenient to use dedicated data structures. There are a number of data structure types that come with the standard library, in particular tuples, lists, the `Maybe` type. But it is more instructive to start defining our own.

We can declare new data types using the `data` keyword, the name of the type, the `=` sign, and then a list of *constructors*.

### Enumerations

In the simplest case, we can use this to declare an enumeration type:

```haskell
data Suit = Diamonds | Clubs | Hearts | Spades
```

From now on, we can use the constructors, e.g. `Diamonds` as values of type `Suit`. This is how we *create* values of type `Suit` -- and it is the only way, so we know that every value of type `Suit` is, indeed, one of these four constructors.

When we have a value of type `Suit` then the only thing we can really do with it is to find out which of these four constructors it actually is. The way to do that is using *pattern matching*, for example using the `case … of …` syntax:

```haskell
isRed :: Suit -> Bool
isRed s = case s of
  Diamonds -> True
  Hearts -> True
  _ -> False
```

The expression `case e of …` evaluates the *scrutinee* `e`, and then linearly goes through the list of cases. If the value of the scrutinee matches the *pattern* left of the arrow, the whole expression evaluates to the right-hand side. We see two kinds of patterns here: Constructor patterns like `Diamonds`, which match simply when the value is the constructor, and the *wildcard pattern*, written as an underscore, which matches any value.

It is common to immediately pattern match on the parameter of a function, so Haskell supports pattern-matching directly in the function definition:
```haskell
isRed :: Suit -> Bool
isRed Diamonds = True
isRed Hearts = True
isRed _ = False
```

The type `Bool` that we have already used before is nothing else but one of these enumeration types, defined as
```haskell
data Bool = False | True
```
and we could do without `if … then … else …` by pattern-matching on `Bool`:
```haskell
ifThenElse :: Bool -> a -> a -> a
ifThenElse True x y = x
ifThenElse False x y = y
```
the only reason to have `if … then … else …`  is that it is a bit more readable.

### Constructor with parameters

So far, the constructors were just plain values. But we can also turn them into “containers” of sort, where we can store other values. As an basic example, maybe we want to introduce complex numbers:

```
data Complex = C Integer Integer
```
(Mathematically educated readers please excuse the use of `Integers` here).

This creates a new type `Complex`, with a constructor `C`. But `C` itself is not a value of type `Complex`, but rather it is a function that creates values of type `Complex` and, crucially, it is the only way of creating values of type `Complex`. We can ask for the type of `C` and see that it is indeed just a function:
```
Prelude> :t C
C :: Integer -> Integer -> Complex
```
so it should be clear how to use it:
```haskell
origin :: Complex
origin = C 0 0
```

Again, and as always, the way to use a complex number is by pattern matching. This time we use pattern matching not to distinguish different cases -- *every* `Complex` is a `C` -- but to extract the parameters of the constructor:

```haskell
addC :: Complex -> Complex -> Complex
addC (C x1 y1) (C x2 y2) = C (x1 + x2) (y1 + y2)
```

The parameter in a pattern -- the `x1` here -- can itself be a pattern, for example `0` (which matches only the number 0), or underscore:
```haskell
isReal :: Complex -> Bool
isReal (C 0 _) = True
isReal _ = False
```

A type like `Complex`, with exactly one constructor, is called a *product type*. But we can of course have types with more than one constructor and constructor arguments:
```haskell
data Riemann = Complex Complex | Infinity
```
This declares a new type `Riemann` that can be built using one of these two constructors:

 1. The constructor `Complex`, which takes one argument, of type `Complex`. Types and terms (including constructors) have different namespaces, so we can have a type called `Complex`, and a constructor called `Complex`, and they can be completely independent. This can be confusing, but is rather idiomatic.

    The type of `Complex` shows that we can use it as a function, to create a point of the `Riemann` sphere from a complex number:
    ```
    Prelude> :t Complex
    Complex :: Complex -> Riemann
    ```
 2. The constructor `Infinity` takes no arguments, and simply is a value of type `Riemann` itself.

When we pattern match on a value of type `Riemann`, we learn whether it was created using `Complex` or `Infinity`, and in the former case, we also get the complex number passed to it:
```haskell
addR :: Riemann -> Riemann -> Riemann
addR (Complex c1) (Complex c2) = Complex (c1 `add` c2)
addR Infinity _  = Infinity
addR _ Infinity  = Infinity
```

A data type that has more than one constructor is commonly called a *sum type*. So these data types are built from sums and products, and hence are called algebraic data types (ADTs).

### Recursive data types

It it worth pointing out that it is completely fine to haven a constructor argument of the type that we are currently defining. This way, we obtain a *recursive data type*, and this is the foundation for many important data structures, in particular lists and trees of various sorts. Here is a simple example, a binary tree with numbers on all internal nodes:
```haskell
data Tree = Leaf | Node Integer Tree Tree
```
Again, this can be read as “a value of type `Tree` is either a `Leaf`, or it is a `Node` that contains a value of type `Integer` and references to two subtrees.”

There is nothing particularly interesting about constructing such a tree (use `Leaf` and `Node`) and traversing it (use pattern matching).  Here is a piece of idiomatic code that inserts a new number into a tree:
```haskell
insert :: Integer -> Tree -> Tree
insert x Leaf = Node x Leaf Leaf
insert x (Node y t1 t2)
    | y < x     = Node y t1 (insert x t2)
    | otherwise = Node y (insert x t1) t2
```
This code shows a new, syntactic feature: Pattern guards! These are Boolean expressions that you can use to further restrict when a case is taken. The third case in this function definition is only used if `y < x`, otherwise the following cases are tried. Of course this could be written using `if … then … else …`, but the readability and aesthetics are better with pattern guards. The value `otherwise` is simply `True`, but this reads better.


### Polymorphic data types

The tree data type declared in the previous section ought to be useful not just for integers, but maybe for any type. But it would be seriously annoying to have to create a new tree data type for each type we want to store in the tree. Therefore, we haven have *polymorphic data types*. In the example of the tree, we can write:
```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
```

You may remember that the `a` here ought to be a type variable, because it occurs in the place of a type, but is lower-case. When we want to use this tree data type at a concrete type, say `Integer`, we simply write `Tree Integer`:
```haskell
insert :: Integer -> Tree Integer -> Tree Integer
```
The actual code of the function does not change.

We can also write functions that work on polymorphic trees, i.e. which we can use on *any* `Tree`, no matter what type the values in the nodes are. A good example is:
```haskell
size :: Tree a -> Integer
size Leaf = 0
size (Node _ t1 t2) = 1 + size t1 + size t2
```
Again, parametricity makes the type signature of such a function more useful than it seems at first: Just from looking at the type signature of `size` we *know* that this function does not look at the values stored in the nodes. Together with the name, that is really all the documentation we might need. Compare this to `size :: Tree Integer -> Integer` -- now it could just as well be that this function includes the number stored in the node in the result somehow.

### Functions in data types ★

Maybe this is obvious to you, after the emphasis on functions in the first chapter, but it is still worth pointing out that data type can also store functions. This blurs the distinction between data and code some more, as this nice example shows:
```haskell
data Stream a b
    = NeedInput (a -> Stream a b)
    | HasOutput b (Stream a b)
    | Done
```
The type `Stream a b` models a state machine that consumes values of type `a`, produces values of type `b`, and maybe eventually stops. Such a machine is in one of three states:

 1. Waiting for input. This uses the `NeedInput` constructor, which carries a *function* that consumes a type of value `a` and returns the new state of the machine.
 2. Producing output. This uses the `HasOutput` constructor, which stores the output value of type `b`, and the subsequent state of the machine.
 3. `Done`.

We can create a state machine that does run-length encoding this way. This one does not ever stop, but that’s fine:

```haskell
rle :: Eq a => Stream a (Integer,a)
rle = NeedInput rle_start

rle_start :: Eq a => a -> Stream a (Integer, a)
rle_start x = NeedInput (rle_count x 1)

rle_count :: Eq a => a -> Integer -> a -> Stream a (Integer, a)
rle_count x n x' | x == x' = NeedInput (rle_count x (n + 1))
                 | otherwise = HasOutput (n, x) (rle_start x')
```

Predefined data types
--------------------

We intentionally discussed the mechanisms of algebraic data types first, so that we can explain the most common data types in the standard library easily.

### Booleans ★

As mentioned before, the values `True` and `False` are simply the constructors of a data type defined as
```haskell
data Bool = False | True
```

There is nothing magic about the definition of `Bool`. But this type plays a special role because of the `if … then … else …` construct, and because of the pattern guards seen before.

### `Maybe`

A very common use case for algebraic data types is to capture the idea of a type whose values “maybe contain nothing, or just a value of type `a`”. Because this is so common, such a data type is predefined:
```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

You might see `Maybe`, for example, in the return type of a function that deserializes a binary or textual representation of a type, for example:
```haskell
parseFoo :: String -> Maybe Foo
```
Such an operation can fail, and if the input is invalid, it would return `Nothing`. As a user of such a function, the only way to get to the value of type `a` therein is to pattern-match on the result, which forces me to think about and handle the case where the result is `Nothing`.

This is much more robust than the common idiom in C, where you have to remember to check for particular error values (-1, or `NULL`), or Go, where you get both a result and a separate error code, but you can still be lazy and use the result without checking the error code.

A big part of Haskell’s reputation as a language that makes it easier to write correct code relies on the use of data types to precisely describe the values you are dealing with.

::: Exercise
How many values are there of type `Maybe (Maybe Bool)`. When can it be useful to nest `Maybe` in that way?
:::

::: Solution
There are four: `Nothing`, `Just Nothing`, `Just False` and `Just True`. It can be useful if, for example, the outer `Maybe` indicates whether some input was *valid*, whereas `Just Nothing` could indicate that the input was valid, but empty. But arguably this is not best practice, and dedicated data types with more speaking names could be preferred here.
:::

### `Either` ★

With maybe we can express “one or none”. Sometimes we want “one or another” type. For this, the standard library provides
```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
```

Commonly, this type is used for computations that can fail, but that provide some useful error messages when they fail:
```haskell
parseFoo :: String -> Either ParseError Foo
```
This gives us the same robustness benefits of `Maybe`, but also a more helpful error messages. If used in this way, then the `Left` value is always used for the error or failure case, and the `Right` value for when everything went all right.

### Tuples

Imagine you are writing a function that wants to return two numbers -- say, the last digit the rest of the number. The way to do that that you know so far would require defining a data type:
```haskell
data TwoIntegers = TwoIntegers Integer Integer
splitLastDigit :: Integer -> TwoIntegers
splitLastDigit n = TwoIntegers (n `div` 10) (n `mod` 10)
```

Clearly, the concept of “passing around two values together“ is not particularly tied to `Integer`, and we can use polymorphism to generalize this definition:
```haskell
data Two a b = Two a b
splitLastDigit :: Integer -> Two Integer Integer
splitLastDigit n = Two (n `div` 10) (n `mod` 10)
```

And because this is so useful, Haskell comes with built-in support for such pairs, including a nice and slim syntax:
```haskell
data (a,b) = (a,b) -- morally this is how it is defined
splitLastDigit :: Integer -> (Integer, Integer)
splitLastDigit n = (n `div` 10, n `mod` 10)
```

Besides tuples, which store two values, there are triples, quadruples and, in general, n-tuples of any size you might encounter. But really, if these tuples get larger than two or three, the code starts to smell.

Their size is always fixed and statically known at compile time, and you can have values of different types as components of the tuple. This distinguishes them from the lists we will see shortly.

::: Exercise
How could you represent the Riemann numbers from the previous section using only these predefined data types?
:::

::: Solution
```haskell
Maybe (Integer, Integer)
```
:::

Useful predefined functions related to tuples are
```haskell
fst :: (a,b) -> a
snd :: (a,b) -> b
```
and because of their type I do not have to tell you what they do.

### The unit type

There is also a zero-tuple, so to say: The unit type written `()` with only the value `()`:
```haskell
data () = () -- morally this is how it is defined
```
While this does not look very useful yet, we will see that it plays a crucial role later. Until then, you can think of it as a good choice when we have something polymorphic, but we do not actually need an “interesting” type there.

::: Exercise
Write functions `fromEitherUnit :: Either () a -> Maybe a` and `toEitherUnit :: Maybe a -> Either () a` that are inverses to each other. In one of these type signatures you can replace `()` with a new type variable `b`, and still implement the function. In which one? Why?
:::

::: Solution
```haskell
fromEitherUnit :: Either () a -> Maybe a
fromEitherUnit (Left ()) = Nothing
fromEitherUnit (Right x) = Just x

toEitherUnit :: Maybe a -> Either () a
toEitherUnit Nothing = Left ()
toEitherUnit (Just x) = Right x
```
We can make `fromEitherUnit` more polymorphic; it can simply ignore the argument to `Left`. We cannot do this in `toEitherUnit`: we would not have a value of type `b` at hand to pass to `Left`.
:::

### Lists

In the previous section we defined trees using a recursive data type. It should be obvious that we can define lists in a very analogous way:
```haskell
data List a = Empty | Link a (List a)
```

This data structure is so ubiquitous in functional programming that it not only comes with the standard library, it also has very special, magic syntax:
```haskell
data [a] = [] | a : [a]
```
In words: The type `[a]` is the type of lists with values of type `a`. Such a list is either the empty list, written as `[]`, or it is a non-empty list containing of a head `x` of type `a`, and a tail `xs`, and is written as `x:xs`. Note that the constructor `(:)`, called “cons”, is using operator syntax.

There is more special syntax for lists:

1. Finite lists can be written as `[1, 2, 3]` instead of `1 : 2 : 3 : []`.
2. Lists of numbers can be enumerated, e.g. `[1..10]`, or `[0,2..10]`, or even (due to laziness) `[1..]`.
3. List comprehensions look like `[ (x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys, x < y ]`, reminiscent of the set comprehension syntax from mathematics. We will not discuss them now, I just wanted to show them and tell you what to search for.

Common operations on lists worth knowing are `(++)` to concatenate two lists. 

Lists are very useful for many applications, but they are not a particularly high-performance data structure -- random access and concatenation is expensive, and they use quite a bit of memory. Depending on the application, other types like arrays/vectors, finger trees, difference lists might be more suitable.

### Characters and strings ★

Unexpectedly, Haskell has built-in support for characters and text. A single character has type `Char`, and is written in single quotes, e.g. `'a'`, `'☃'`, `'\''`, `'\0'`, `'\xcafe'`. These character are Unicode code points, and not just 7 or 8 bit characters.

The built-in type `String` is just an alias for `[Char]`, i.e. a list of characters. Haskell supports special built-in syntax for strings, using double quotes, but this is just syntactic sugar to the list syntax:
```
Prelude> "hello"
"hello"
Prelude> ['h','e','l','l','o']
"hello"
Prelude> 'h':'e':'l':'l':'o':[]
"hello"
```

Because `String` is built on the list type, all the usual list operations, in particular `++` for concatenation, work on strings as well.

But `String` also has the same performance issues as lists: While it is fine to use them  in non-critical parts of the code (diagnostic and error messages, command line and configuration file parsing, filenames), `String` is usually the wrong choice if large amounts of strings need to be processed, e.g. in a templating library. Additionally libraries provide more suitable data structures, in particular `ByteString` for binary data and `Text` for human-readable text.

Records ★
---------

Assume you want to create a type that represents an employee in a HR database. There are a fair number of field to store -- name, date of birth, employee number, room, login handle, public key etc. You could use a tuple with many fields, or create your own data type with a constructor with many fields, but either way you will have to address the various fields by their position, which is verbose, easy to get wrong, and hard to extend.

In such a case, you can use records. These allow you to give names to the *field* of a constructor, and get some convenience functions along the way. The syntax to declare the record is
```haskell
data Employee = Employee
    { name :: String
    , room :: Integer
    , pubkey :: ByteString
    }
```

In terms of the constructor `Employee`, this is equivalent to
```
data Employee = Employee String Integer ByteString
```
and it is always possible to use `Employee` as a normal prefix function in terms and patterns. But the record syntax declaration enables the following nicer syntaxes:

1. Record creation: Instead of `Employee n r p` you can write `Employee { name = n; room = r; pubkey = p }`, and of course the order of the fields is irrelevant.

2. Record pattern matching. You can also write `Employee { name = n; room = r; pubkey = p }` in a pattern, to match on `Employee` and get `n`, `r` and `p` into scope.

3. Record update syntax: If we have `e :: Employee`, then `e { room = r' }` is like an `Employee` and all fields are the same as `e` with the exception of `room`.

4. The names of the fields are available as getters, i.e. after the above definition of `Employee`, there is a function `name :: Employee -> String` etc.

Curiously, the record creation or update syntax binds closer than function applications: `g x { f = y }` is `g (x { f = y })`, and *not* `(g x) { f = y }`.

With the language extension `RecordWildCards` enabled, it is even possible to write `Employee{..}` in a pattern, and get *all* fields of the employee record into scope, as variables, as if one had written `Employee { name = name; room = room; pubkey = pubkey }`.


Newtypes ★
----------

Sometimes you will see a type declaration that uses `newtype` instead of `data`:
```haskell
newtype Riemann = Riemann (Maybe (Integer, Integer))
```

For all purposes relevant to us so far you can mentally replace `newtype` with `data`. There are difference in memory representation (a `newtype` is “free” in some sense), but none that relevant at our current level.


Type synonyms ★
---------------

Haskell allows you to introduce new names for existing types. One example is the type `String`, which is defined as
```haskell
type String = [Char]
```

With this declaration, you can use `String` instead of `[Char]` in your type signatures. They are completely interchangeable, and a value of type `String` is still just a list of characters.

So type synonyms do not introduce any kind of type safety, they merely make types more readable.

Haddock ★
---------

Because knowing the type of a function is already a big step towards understanding what it does, the usual way of documenting a Haskell API is very much centered around types. The tool `haddock` creates HTML pages from Haskell source files that list all functions with their type, and -- if present -- the documentation that is attached to it via a comment.

For Haskell libraries hosted in the central package repository *Hackage*, this documentation is also provided. For example, you can learn all about the types  and functions that are available by default by reading the [haddock page for the prelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Prelude.html). (There is a bunch of noise there that might not be relevant to you, like long lists of “Instances”. You can skip over them.)

From this documentation you will also find links labeled “Source” that take you to the definition of a type or function in the source code, in a syntax-highlighted and crosslinked presentation of the source.


Code structure small and large
==============================

The next big topic we need to learn about are the ways with which the programmer structures the code. This happens on multiple levels

 * in a function: intermediate results are named, local helper functions are defined.
 * within a file: functions, type signatures, and documentation is arranged.
 * within a project (library, package): code is spread out in different files,and imported from other files.
 * between projects: packages are versioned, equipped with meta-data, and depend on each other.


`let`-expressions
-----------------

The most basic way of adding some structure within an expression is to give a name to a subexpression, and possibly use it later. So instead of
```haskell
isMultipleOf3 x = fixEq sumDigits x == 3 || fixEq sumDigits x == 6 || fixEq sumDigits x == 9
```
one could write
```haskell
isMultipleOf3 x =
  let y = fixEq sumDigits x
  in y == 3 || y == 6 || y == 9
```
which is arguably easier to read.

Be careful: A `let` expression in Haskell can always be recursive, so
```haskell
isMultipleOf3 x =
  let x = fixEq sumDigits x
  in x == 3 || x == 6 || x == 9
```
does *not* work as expected.

In such a `let` expression, you can also do pattern-matching, e.g. to unpack a tuple:
```haskell
sumDigitsWith :: (Integer -> Integer) -> Integer -> Integer
sumDigitsWith f n
  | n < 10 = f n
  | otherwise =
    let (r,d) = splitLastDigit n
    in sumDigitsWith f r + f d
```
This is a fine and innocent thing to do if the pattern is *irrefutable*, i.e. always succeeds, but is a code smell if it is a pattern that can fail, e.g. `Just x = something`. In the latter case, a `case` statement might be more appropriate.

We can also define whole functions in a `let`-expression, just like on the top level. This might improve the code of our run-length-encoding automaton:
```haskell
rle :: Eq a => Stream a (Integer,a)
rle =
  let start x = NeedInput (count x 1)
      count x n x' | x == x' = NeedInput (count x (n + 1))
                       | otherwise = HasOutput (n, x) (start x')
  in NeedInput start
```
One advantage of this is that the “internal” functions `start` and `count` are now no longer available from the outside, and so a reader of this code knows for sure that these are purely internal. We can also drop the `rle_` prefix.

Another important advantage is that such local functions have access to the parameters of the enclosing function. To see this in action, let us extend `rle` with a parameter that indicates a element of the stream that should make the automaton stop:

```haskell
rle :: Eq a => a -> Stream a (Integer,a)
rle stop =
  let start x | x == stop = Done
              | otherwise = NeedInput (count x 1)
      count x n x' | x == x' = NeedInput (count x (n + 1))
                   | otherwise = HasOutput (n, x) (start x')
  in NeedInput start
```
In `start` we can now access `stop` just fine. If `start` and `count` were not local functions, then we would have to add `stop` as an explicit parameter to *both* local functions, significantly cluttering the code with administrative details.


`where`-clauses ★
-----------------

I think few syntactic features show that Haskell’s syntax is designed with readability in mind, valuing that higher than syntactic minimalism, as well as the `where` clauses.

Looking the previous version of the `rle` program, a very picky reader might complain that it is annoying to have to first read past `start` and `count` to see the last line, when the last line tells the reader how it all starts, and thus should be first.

Therefore, the programmer has the option to use a `where`-clause instead of a `let` expression here. A `where`-clause is attached to a function equation (or, more rarely, to a match in a `case` expression), has access to its parameters and – most crucially – is written after or below the right-hand side of the equation:
```haskell
rle :: Eq a => a -> Stream a (Integer,a)
rle stop = NeedInput start
  where
    start x | x == stop = Done
            | otherwise = NeedInput (count x 1)
    count x n x' | x == x' = NeedInput (count x (n + 1))
                 | otherwise = HasOutput (n, x) (start x')
```

It is not a huge change, but one that – in my humble opinion – improves readability by a small but noticeable bit.

If you have a function with multiple guards on one equation, such as `start`, then a `where` clause would scope over all such guards. So we could write
```haskell
sumDigitsWith :: (Integer -> Integer) -> Integer -> Integer
sumDigitsWith f n
  | n < 10 = f d
  | otherwise = sumDigitsWith f r + f d
  where (r,d) = splitLastDigit n
```
(note that `d` is used in both right-hand sides) if we wanted.

The structure of a module
-------------------------

As we zoom out one step, we get to look at a Haskell file as a whole. In Haskell, every file is also a Haskell *module*, and modules serve to provide namespacing support.

Normally, a Haskell module named `Foo.Bar.Baz` lives in a file `Foo/Bar/Baz.hs`, and begins with
```haskell
module Foo.Bar.Baz where
```
Haskell module names are always capitalized.

If a file does not have such a header (which is usually only the case for experiments and the entry point of a Haskell program), then it is implicitly called `Main`. This is why the GHCi prompt says `Main>` after loading such a file.

The rest of the module is are declarations: Values, functions, types, type synonyms etc. The important bit to know here is that the order of declarations is completely irrelevant: You can use functions you that are defined further down, you can mix type and function declarations, you can even separate the type signature of a function from its definition (but you have to keep multiple equations of one function together). This allows the author to sort functions by topic, or by relevance, rather than by dependency, and it is not uncommon to first show the main entry-point of a module, and put all the helper functions it uses below.

Importing other modules
-----------------------

Obviously, the point of having multiple files of Haskell code is to use the code from one in the other. This is achieved using `import` statements, which *must* come right after the `module` header, and before any declarations.

So if we have a file `Target.hs` with content
```haskell
module Target where
who :: String
who = "world"
```
and another file `Tropes.hs` with content
```haskell
module Tropes where

import Target

greeting :: String
greeting = "Hello " ++ who ++ "!"
```
then the use of `who` in `greeting` refers to the definition in the file `Target.hs`.

We could also write
```haskell
greeting :: String
greeting = "Hello " ++ Target.who ++ "!"
```
and use the *fully qualified* name of `who`. This can be useful for disambiguation, or simply for clarity. There must not be spaces around the period, or else it would refer to the composition operator.

If we only ever intend to use the things we import from a module in their qualified names, we can use a *qualified* import:
```haskell
import qualified Target
```
And if the module has a long name, we can shorten it:
```haskell
import qualified Target as T
```
and write `T.who`. This is a common idiom for modules like `Data.Text` that export many names that would otherwise clash with names from the prelude.

The standard library, called `base`, comes with [many modules you can import](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) in addition to the `Prelude` module, which is always imported implicitly.

Import lists ★
--------------

If we do not want to import *all* names of another module, we can import just a specific selection, e.g.:
```haskell
import Data.Maybe (mapMaybe)
```
This makes it easier for someone reading the code to locate where a certain function is from, and it makes the code more robust against breakage when a new version of the other module starts exporting additional names. These would not silently override other names, but cause compiler errors about ambiguous names.

When including an operator in this list, include it in parenthesis:
```haskell
import Data.Function ((&), on)
```

You can import types just as well, just include them in the list. To import *constructors* (which look like types), you have to list them after the type they belong to. So if we put our definitions of `Complex` and `Riemann` into a file `Riemann.hs`, namely
```haskell
module Riemann where
data Complex = C Integer Integer
data Riemann = Complex Complex | Infinity
```
then you can import everything using
```haskell
import Riemann (Complex(C), Riemann(Complex, Infinity))
```
or, shorter,
```haskell
import Riemann (Complex(..), Riemann(..))
```

Export lists and abstract types ★
---------------------------------

You can not only restrict what you import, but also what you export. To do so, you list the names of functions, types, etc. that you want to export after the module name:
```
module Riemann (Complex, Riemann(..)) where
…
```
A short export list is a great help when trying to understand the role and purpose of a module: If it only exports one or a small number of functions, it is clear that these are the (only) entry points to the code, and that all other declarations are purely internal.

By excluding the constructors of a data type from the export list, as we did in this example with the `Complex` type, we can make this type *abstract*: Users of our module now have no knowledge of the internal structure of `Complex`, and they are unable to create or arbitrarily inspect values of type `Complex`. Instead, they are only able to do so using the *other* functions that we export along with `Complex`. This way we can ensure certain invariant in our types – think of a search tree with the invariant that it is sorted – or reserve the ability to change the shape of the type without breaking depending code.

Proper user of abstract types greatly helps to make code more readable, more maintainable and more robust, quite similar to how polymorphism does it on a smaller scale.


Haskell packages ★
------------------

Zooming out some more, we come across packages: A *package* is a collection of modules that are bundled under a single package name. A package contains meta-data (name, version number, author, license...). Packages declare which other packages they depend upon, together with version ranges. All this meta-data can be found in the *Cabal file* called `foo.cabal` in the root directory of the project.

Almost all publicly available Haskell packages are hosted centrally on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/), including the haddock-generated documentation and cross-linked source code. They can be easily installed using the [`cabal` tool](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), or alternative systems like [`stack`](https://www.haskellstack.org/) or [`nix`](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#users-guide-to-the-haskell-infrastructure).
The packages on Hackage cover many common needs and it is expected that a serious Haskell project depends on dozen of Haskell packages from Hackage.
